        objectives : introduce the tracker, its objective and added value + show snapshots of data to drive exploration 
        
        Presentation of the tracker   
        Objective of the tracker: Collect, format, and make available data from Country-by-Country Reports (CbCRs) disclosed by companies  
        Why : facilitate access to CbCR data to all  
        CbCRs data is instrumental for analyzing companies' tax practices  
        CbCRs data is public but not centralized/standardized, hence difficult to access  
        Difficulty to access will grow as way more reports are expected  
        Snapshot of the database  
        Overview of available data  
        Number of tracked reports  
        Number of companies with at least one report  
        Breakdown of the number of companies with at least one report by hq country/sector

        Detect suspicious behavior by looking at countries with high profits but few employees / high profit per employee : fake data viz  
        Analyze presence in countries considered tax havens : fake data viz  
        Database growth  
        Number of reports actual growth : Number of tracked reports over time
